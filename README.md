# Xcrypter Project
Written in Python3.

Image Encryption System using RSA and AES methods.

• Before attempting to run the script, ensure to install required dependencies. To do this, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If facing any issues with python3 or ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Crypto' or similar error, try installing a creating a virtual environment. Install dependencies and run the script from within this virtual environment. 

Pycryptodome library is used to achieve encryption objectives. Check out library at: https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome
Also attached is some documentation on Pycryptodome.

This project accomplished the following:

•	Developed a user interface via terminal where users can select and upload image files (JPEG, PNG) and implement encryption and decryption processes for both AES and RSA, with the option for users to select their preferred method.

•	Included functionality for both encryption and decryption processes, testing with different image formats.

•	Demonstrated the decryption process to restore the original image using the appropriate key.
